    <h1>A short story abut myself</h1>
    <h2>Litle things about me</h2>
    <h3>This is me</h3>
    <p>
      My name is Paul Emujowho I was born on July 19th 2004, and ever since then
      I have lived with my parents in Obiaruku.<br />
      Obiaruku is a small town located in Delta state which is in the south side
      of Nigeria, and they speak Ukwuani.<br />
      Obiaruku is a town where people of diferent ethnic group reside. My mom is
      from Obiaruku and my dad is from Abraka.<br />
      Abraka is a larger town that shares dries with Obiaruku. This community is
      mostly occupied by students, because <br />
      it is where Delta State Universiy (DELSU)is located and they speak urhobo.
      I am an indigin of Abraka, but I dont know<br />
      how to speak Urhobo beacause I never lived there ever since I was born.<br />

    <h2>My Family Background</h2>
    <p>
      My parents came out of families that are not true christians and what do I
      mean by saying true christians?<br />
      True christians are people who live their lifes according to the Biblle
      standards, these people
      <strong>
        <br />
        love what is good and shun what is bad.
      </strong>
      In the case of my parents famillies, they don't live in<br />
      such ways, they engage in practicies that has to do with idol worship. But
      with all these in mind, they'er <br />
      still considered to me as one f the nicest people in my life. My came out
      their famillies to be true<br />
      worshipers, They did their best in training Me and my siblins to love
      <em> the true God Jehovah.</em> We<br />
      were five boys and two girls as children in our family, but we lost a boy
      and a girl some years ago.<br />
    </p>
    <h2>Myself</h2>
    <p>
      With the help and encuragement from my parents, I grew up to become a
      lover of the truth I had families of<br />
      people from different part of the world, people who ave proven their love
      for me and for Jehovah. These<br />
      people helped me choose the right part and the love they showed me moved
      me to make a big decision that<br />
      changed my life. I gave my live to Jehovah and baptized.<br />
